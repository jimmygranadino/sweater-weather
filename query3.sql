/* QUERY 3
PROBLEM:
You're trapped in the past but determined to enjoy yourself anyway.
It's 2011. You're an avid & optimistic boater but don't like boating alone.
You've fortunately retained your sense of foresight since you bought your home.
You want to pick a state for your next day-long pleasure cruise where you'll
have the greatest chance of encountering other boaters while you're on the water.
As of 2009, according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, one in 10 U.S. households owns a boat,
and you're going to assume for convenience that's true in all 50 states.
You're also guessing there's a 50% chance those boat owners go out on the balmiest day of the year (i.e. 75Â° F, no rain).
Optimizing for these factors and using these facts, census data, and weather data,
in which state and on which top 10 days in 2011 should you set your sights on hitting the water? */
